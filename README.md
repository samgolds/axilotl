# axilotl
Code for computing halo model predictions for axion-induced screening of the CMB.


The theoretical calculations are based on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08059][https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08059] and were used in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10514][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10514].


 Note that the code hasn't been optimized and isn't particularly fast. This is largely pragmatic, but also is consistent with the naming convention. Indeed, ChatGPT says "Axolotls aren’t particularly fast swimmers since they rely on their feathery gills and tail for slow movement. While there’s no precise measurement of their “top speed,” axolotls generally swim at speeds between 1–2 body lengths per second when moving quickly, such as during feeding or escape responses. For a typical axolotl that’s about 20 cm long, this translates to approximately 20–40 cm per second (0.2–0.4 m/s) under normal circumstances. They are better adapted for stealth and ambush predation than for speed."
